# bwtrack

This repo hosts the code for tracking black and white particles in the mini interfacial rheometer developed by my friend Qiaoge.

乔哥牛逼！

I've got very timely and insightful feedbacks from Qiaoge, and I'm optimistic that the method here will become useful for other purposes eventually. So I create this repo to record the progress of the core functions.
